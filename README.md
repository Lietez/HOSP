**Rules:**

We must recognize that in cases of immediate emergencies, players will not be able to join the HOSP alliance, and their addition to the Do Not Hit List (DNH) may be the only protection that they can receive. Demonstrating the importance of not just depending on the HOSP tag. 

Those who may have more forewarning have the ability to join the HOSP alliance as a temporary safeguard while dealing with their emergency situations. 

It is important that the leadership team of any member who will become inactive be aware of their members status. They should provide a screen shot of a player’s profile to the Admiral of HOSP and an invite will be sent to the player to accept. While this player is a part of HOSP, they can take no action in game other than to activate peace shields. If any other action is taken, such as mining, attacking, or participating in events then they are no longer eligible for membership in HOSP or the DNH List.

As a family member or friend may have access to a players game. 1 warning will be given to those members who violate the guidelines for inactivity. A PM will be sent in game to said player and a message to their Alliance leadership. Any further activities after the 1st warning, will result in their removal from HOSP Alliance and the DNH.

**Example of Messages:**

*Leadership: “Your member [Name] at [Date and Time] has been found to be active in violation of HOSP guidelines, please provide a return invite for said member, or reverify their eligibility. If no response is received in 24 hrs or they continue to violate the no activity guidelines, they will be removed from HOSP and from the DNH List.*

**_The Server 13 Community is important_ to the effectiveness of this endeavor.**
